**Project Summary: Boat Sales Analysis Dashboard**

The Boat Sales Analysis project aims to create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data from an Excel spreadsheet and a SQL database. The primary goal is to gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and inventory management, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Integration:** 
   - Import sales data from Excel, including key metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics.
   - Connect to a SQL database to retrieve additional data like inventory levels and supplier information.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Use Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the dataset.
   - Create calculated columns and measures to derive insights such as average sales per boat type and revenue growth trends.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Develop a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to represent sales trends, customer demographics, and inventory levels.
   - Implement slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration, allowing users to segment data by region, boat type, and time periods.

4. **Insights and Reporting:**
   - Include key performance indicators (KPIs) to track sales targets and performance metrics.
   - Create a narrative dashboard that provides actionable insights, helping stakeholders identify growth opportunities and optimize inventory management.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of boat sales performance, enhancing decision-making and strategic planning.
